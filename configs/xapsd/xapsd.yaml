# Notifications that are not initiated by new messages are not sent immediately for two reasons:
# 1. When you move/copy/delete messages you most likely move/copy/delete more messages within a short period of time.
# 2. You don't need your mailboxes to synchronize immediately since they are automatically synchronized when opening
#    the app
# If a new message comes and the move/copy/delete notification is still on hold it will be sent with the notification
# for the new message.
# This sets the interval to check for delayed messages.
checkInterval: 20

# Set the time how long notifications for not-new messages should be delayed until they are sent.
# Whenever checkInterval runs, it checks if "delay" <= "waiting time" and sends the notification if the expression is
# true.
